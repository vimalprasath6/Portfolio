# Vimal Prasath A | Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal developer portfolio, built using **React.js**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, and **Node.js**.  
It showcases my projects, skills, and experience through a responsive and performance-optimized design.

## Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|
| React.js | Component-based frontend framework for building dynamic user interfaces. |
| Tailwind CSS v4 | Utility-first CSS framework used for responsive and modern styling. |
| Node.js | Backend runtime for server-side features and build support. |
| Vite | Development tool providing fast bundling and optimized builds. |

## React Implementation Details

1. **Component-Based Architecture**  
   The project follows a modular structure, where each UI section (Navbar, Hero, About, Projects, Contact) is a standalone React component.  
   This improves scalability, reusability, and code organization.

2. **Hooks Usage**  
   Utilizes `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef` to manage state, lifecycle events, and DOM interactions.  
   These hooks make the application interactive and maintainable.

3. **Dynamic Data Rendering**  
   Project details, skill sets, and contact information are stored in data objects and mapped into React components dynamically.  
   This ensures clean and easily maintainable code.

4. **Routing and Layouts**  
   The structure allows easy integration of additional routes or pages using React Router, maintaining a consistent layout across all sections.

## Tailwind CSS v4 Usage

1. **Responsive and Utility-First Design**  
   The UI adapts to all screen sizes using Tailwind’s responsive classes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`).  
   Layouts, grids, and spacing are defined through utility classes, ensuring a consistent and maintainable design system.

2. **Custom Theme Configuration**  
   The Tailwind configuration extends color palettes, fonts, and transitions for a personalized theme matching the portfolio’s style.

3. **Improved Performance**  
   Tailwind v4 automatically purges unused CSS, keeping build sizes minimal and performance high.

4. **Reusable Styles**  
   Common elements like buttons, cards, and section containers follow shared class patterns, improving visual consistency.

## Node.js Role in the Project

1. **Development Server**  
   Node.js powers the local development environment through Vite for rapid live reloading and bundling.

2. **Scalability for Backend Integration**  
   The project structure is compatible with Node.js-based backends for features like form submissions or database integration, allowing future expansion.

3. **Environment Configuration**  
   Node is used to manage dependencies, scripts, and environment variables for deployment and build optimization.
